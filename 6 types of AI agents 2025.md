* 6 types of AI agents that are shaping 2025 (and how to spot their value fast)

* Let’s break it down:
1. UI interaction agents
  * These are your “click like a human” sidekicks. They navigate software by mimicking human gestures, think AI that can file an expense report or edit a doc without needing custom code.

2️. Workflow automation agents
  * These agents chain actions across apps, skipping the “glue code” headache. They're built for scale—automating multi-step ops from onboarding flows to CRM syncs.

3️. Knowledge retrieval agents
  * Context-aware and fast. These pull precise answers from internal data stores, vector DBs, or live web search—ideal for internal support bots or AI copilots.

4️. Coding & dev agents
  * The new dev team MVPs. They assist with debugging, code review, environment setup, and even full-stack scaffolding.

5️. Tool-specific agents
  * These are specialized and API-savvy—agents that book meetings, send emails, or analyze sales dashboards on command. Think focused, not generalist.

6️. Voice interaction agents
  * These power voice-based products: call centers, voice UIs, and even real-time translators. They're evolving fast thanks to better speech-to-text and memory systems.
