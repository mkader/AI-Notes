* 12 agentic AI concepts everyone building with LLMs should know (no PhD required)

* Agentic AI = AI that thinks, plans, and acts on its own.

* Whether you're prototyping your first AI agent or scaling an enterprise use case, these 12 core ideas are the foundation. 

* Here's your crash course in plain English⤵️ 

  1. Agent: An AI system that senses, decides, and acts toward goals—without constant hand-holding.
  1. Agency: The power to operate independently and make its own choices.
  1. LLM (Large Language Model): The brain. Trained on tons of text to generate smart, context-aware responses.
  1. Planning: Mapping out the steps to hit a goal (instead of just reacting).
  1. Reasoning: Making connections between facts to draw conclusions.
  1. Tool use: Using APIs, databases, or other software to extend capabilities.
  1. Chain-of-thought: Step-by-step thinking that makes the AI’s logic easier to follow—and trust.
  1. RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation): Pulling in external info in real time to improve answers.
  1. Hallucination: When the AI sounds confident but gives false info. Still a big issue.
  1. Memory: Storing past interactions to make future ones more useful or personalized.
  1. Prompt engineering: Crafting the right inputs to get the best outputs. (Yes, it’s an art.)
  1. Self-reflection: Reviewing its own decisions to improve over time—without being told.

* These aren’t just concepts—they’re levers you can pull to design smarter, more capable systems.
