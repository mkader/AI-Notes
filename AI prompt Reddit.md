* The AI prompt Reddit calls a “$20K growth consultant”

* Can a single prompt really audit your business like a top-tier strategist?
* Reddit thinks this one can.

* This power prompt breaks down your strategy using a consultant’s lens:
  1. Maps your competitive landscape
  1. Surfaces untapped growth levers
  1. cores and ranks strategic moves by feasibility and impact

* Whether you’re trying to fix a leaky funnel, rework pricing, or outmaneuver competitors, this prompt doesn’t just analyze, it prioritizes. 

* It works because it:
  1. Uses smart framing (expert persona)
  1. Provides structured inputs (business model + challenges)
  1. Pushes for deep pattern-matching (competitive research)
  1. Ends in usable outputs (prioritized actions)

* It’s long. It’s nerdy. And it might just be your new secret weapon.
