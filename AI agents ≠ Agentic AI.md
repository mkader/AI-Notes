* AI agents ≠ Agentic AI, here's why

* Most of today’s AI tools? They’re still AI agents.
* Good at one thing. Triggered by a prompt. 
* Great for tasks like scheduling, email sorting, or customer support.

* But what’s next is a whole different level: Agentic AI.
* These aren’t just tools they’re teams.
    1. Multiple agents working together: One plans the task, One researches, One writes, One cleans it up and formats

* They can talk to each other, learn from mistakes, and adapt in real time.
    1. Real-world examples are already here:
        * Multi-agent research assistants
        * Swarms of robots picking fruit
        * AI teams helping doctors make faster decisions
        * Cybersecurity systems coordinating threat responses
