# what MCP (Model Context Protocol) does

* What if your AI agents just knew how to talk to Slack, Gmail, GitHub, or your internal tools—contextually?

* That’s what MCP (Model Context Protocol) does.

* It’s the missing link between your agents and the real world.

* This diagram says it all 👇
  1. MCP makes any tool, API, or datasource “plug-and-play” for agent frameworks.
  2. No hardcoding. No duct tape. Just endpoints that understand each other.
  3. Context-aware. Secure. Scalable.

* If you’re building agents, tools, or infra—this is your new protocol layer.
