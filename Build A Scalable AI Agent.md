* The real challenge isn’t building an agent that works. It’s building one that works consistently, integrates across tools, adapts to dynamic goals, and scales without breaking. 

* Real starter pack: 
  1. ➡️Pick your framework wisely
      * Agent SDK
      * CrewAI
      * LangGraph
      * Autogen

  2. ➡️Integrate with purpose
      * Use APIs for diversity. 
      * Use MCP servers for orchestration.
      * Don’t DIY everything.

  3. ➡️Implement reasoning frameworks
      * Logic is not optional. It’s the brain, not just the face.

  4. ➡️Get memory right
      * Short-term: Real-time context
      * Long-term: Knowledge that sticks
      * Tools to try: Zep, MemGPT, Letta

  5. ➡️Choose your knowledge base
      * Vector DB
      * Graph DB
      * Knowledge Graph DB (if your use case really needs it)

* This isn’t theoretical. It’s what teams are doing to move from demo to deploy.
