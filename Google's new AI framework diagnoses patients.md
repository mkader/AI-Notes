* Google's new AI framework diagnoses patients, chats like a doc, and grades itself

* Step 1️⃣: Simulate a real patient
  1. Synthetic profiles built from real medical datasets, Google search context, and OSCE clinical training data. Each scenario includes symptoms, backstory, and what the patient will or won’t say unless prompted.

* Step 2️⃣: Run the full consultation
  1. A doctor AI (AMIE) chats with a patient AI. Multimodal reasoning allows image uploads. Conversations mimic real-world telehealth: concise, human, and reactive.

* Step 3️⃣: Score it like a clinician would
  An auto-rater evaluates diagnostic accuracy, hallucination risks, treatment choices, and overall reasoning—then justifies each rating. Think: AI peer review at scale.
