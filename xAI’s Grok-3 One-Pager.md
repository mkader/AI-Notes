* But what makes it so powerful?
  1. Grok 3 has been trained on the Colossus supercomputer with 100K Nvidia H100 GPUs. According to one stat, it has been trained for 200 million GPU hours. The key capabilities of Grok 3 are coding, science research, problem-solving, creating marketing campaigns, personalized assistance, and API integration.

* Some special features of Grok 3 are:
  1. DeepSearch: Allows Grok to search the web and X posts for real-time data and information.
  1. Think Mode: Decompose complex queries into steps just like human problem-solving.
  1. Big Brain Mode: A heavy-duty mode for intensive tasks like simulations, data analysis, or reasoning.

* Here’s how Grok 3 possibly works:
  1. Grok 3 supports multi-modal inputs. The user can ask questions as text, upload images, or talk to Grok. The inputs are tokenized to initiate processing.
  1. Synthetic data training enhances the query interpretation.
  1. This is fed to the core transformer model that analyzes the input.
  1. The core transformer issues a search directive to DeepSearch to retrieve necessary information from the web or real-time X data.
  1. Next, a self-correct process ensures accuracy through an internal feedback loop.
  1. Depending on the user’s input, the Think Mode or Big Brain Mode refines the responses as required. It might again use DeepSearch to find more information.
  1. The answers are delivered to the user in a multimodal manner.
