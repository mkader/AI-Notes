* OpenAI just dropped a 34-page playbook on building real AI agents

* So what is an agent, really?
  1. It makes decisions and executes multi-step workflows for you
  2. It knows when to stop, hand off to a human, or retry
  3. It uses tools (APIs, databases, CRMs, etc.) to do things, not just say things

* Here’s where agents shine:
  1. Complex decisions (think refund approvals or legal triage)
  2. Workflows too messy for traditional automation (like vendor reviews)
  3. Tasks that live in natural language (like summarizing contracts or troubleshooting support tickets)

* Want to build one? Start simple:
  1. Pick a real workflow that frustrates people or breaks often
  2. Use one agent first, not five
  3. Add tools slowly (like APIs or DB lookups)
  4. Set guardrails—just like you'd childproof your kitchen
