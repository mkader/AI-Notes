* 6 AI Agent Use Cases that are Dominating Enterprise Adoption⬇️

1. RAG Agents - Not just retrieval bots. These agents evaluate, reason, and respond with context. Internal Q&A, live documentation, dynamic knowledge bases—this is their turf.

2. Workflow Agents - Automate onboarding, approvals, and back-office ops without writing code. Think Zapier 3.0, but with brains. Tools like n8n and Relevance AI are making this stupid simple.

3️. Coding Agents - They're pair programming, debugging, and planning. Tools like Cursor and Windsurf are giving dev teams superpowers.

4️. Tool-based Agents - Email. CRM. Search. These agents handle tight, tactical tasks with precision. They’re modular and plug right in.

5️. Computer Use Agents - They click, they type, they scroll. Powered by GPT-4 and Claude, these agents don’t call APIs—they use the web like humans.

6️. Voice Agents - Sales. Support. Onboarding. They're answering the phone now—fluent, fast, and 24/7. ElevenLabs and Vapi are leading the charge.
