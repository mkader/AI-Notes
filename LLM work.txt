How Do LLMs Actually Work?

LLMs power AI applications like ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Claude to generate human-like text and assist with complex tasks.

LLMs train on huge datasets (books, websites, and code) to recognize patterns and relationships between words. This text is cleaned and broken into tokens—small pieces that a machine can process.

Using transformers (a deep learning technique), LLMs analyze contextual relationships between words. They improve over time by adjusting their internal settings (weights) through gradient descent—a trial-and-error process that minimizes mistakes.

After training, LLMs are fine-tuned for specific applications like coding, or customer support. This is done using supervised learning, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), or Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to improve accuracy.

When you enter a prompt, the LLM processes your input, predicts the most likely next tokens, and generates a response. To improve accuracy and relevance, some models use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)—which searches external knowledge sources (like databases or documents) before generating a response to provide more factual answers. The LLM then applies decoding strategies like beam search and nucleus sampling to refine the final output.

Before deployment, LLMs go through safety filters to remove bias and harmful content. They are also optimized using techniques like quantization and pruning, making them efficient for cloud-based and on-device AI.

LLMs face issues like hallucinations (false outputs), bias, and high computational costs. Engineers optimize them using RAG, speculative decoding, hybrid cloud-edge deployment and other solutions.

LLMs aren’t magic—they’re pattern-recognition machines built with techniques that are continually evolving.
