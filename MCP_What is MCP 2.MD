* What is MCP‚Äîand why should you care?
(GitHub links at the end + open-source code üî•)

* MCP stands for Model-Context Protocol.
  1. It's a common language that lets apps and large language models (LLMs) talk to each other‚Äînot just with prompts, but with structured, shared context.

* Think of it this way:
  1. When you chat with ChatGPT and it ‚Äúremembers‚Äù something about you, that‚Äôs usually inferred from previous messages.
  1. With MCP, that kind of understanding becomes explicit.

* Apps can send clear, structured data like:
  1. who the user is
  1. which tools/APIs are available
  1. what documents or datasets are relevant
  1. what rules or boundaries should be followed
  1. what the LLM should retain during the session

* This transforms LLMs from just smart text generators into: Context-aware, memory-rich, tool-using software agents.

* It‚Äôs still early days, but we‚Äôre already seeing awesome MCP projects popping up. 
  1. <a href ="https://lnkd.in/exnt7E6Y">MCP GitHub (Official)</a>  -  Full docs, specs, SDKs, and examples to get started with structured context. 
  1. <a href ="https://lnkd.in/dTQBb_bB">MCP Server for GitHub</a> - Build smart agents that interact with repos, issues, PRs, and workflows‚Äîpowered by structured context.
  1. <a href="https://lnkd.in/dWPZCcfr">Dive AI Agent (MCP Desktop App)</a> -  Run a local MCP host that connects with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Ollama, and more. Great for testing across platforms.

* MCP is a big step toward smarter, more integrated AI agents. It opens the door to more advanced behaviors‚Äîand helps standardize how LLMs plug into real-world systems.
