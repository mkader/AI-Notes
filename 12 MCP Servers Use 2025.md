* MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open standard that simplifies how AI models, particularly LLMs, interact with external data sources, tools, and services.
* An MCP server acts as a bridge between these AI models and external tools. Here are the top MCP servers:

* File System MCP Server: Allows the LLM to directly access the local file system to read, write, and create directories.

* GitHub MCP Server: Connects Claude to GitHub repos and allows file updates, code searching.

* Slack MCP Server: MCP Server for Slack API, enabling Claude to interact with Slack workspaces.

* Google Maps MCP Server: MCP Server for Google Maps API.

* Docker MCP Server: Integrate with Docker to manage containers, images, volumes, and networks.

* Brave MCP Server: Web and local search using Brave’s Search API.

* PostgreSQL MCP Server: An MCP server that enables LLM to inspect database schemas and execute read-only queries.

* Google Drive MCP Server: An MCP server that integrates with Google Drive to allow reading and searching over files.

* Redis MCP Server: MCP Server that provides access to Redis databases.

* Notion MCP Server: This project implements an MCP server for the Notion API.

* Stripe MCP Server: MCP Server to interact with the Stripe API.

* Perplexity MCP Server: An MCP Server that connects to Perplexity’s Sonar API for real-time search.
