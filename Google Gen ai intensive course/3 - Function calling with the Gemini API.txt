Day 3 - Function calling with the Gemini API
	
	use the Gemini API's automatic function calling to build a chat interface over a local database. 
	This example is a toy and is missing a number of safety and security constraints you would use in a real-world example, 
	but shows how to add AI chat capabilities to existing applications with ease.

		!pip uninstall -qqy jupyterlab  # Remove unused conflicting packages
		!pip install -U -q "google-genai==1.7.0"

		from google import genai
		from google.genai import types
		genai.__version__

		from kaggle_secrets import UserSecretsClient

		GOOGLE_API_KEY = UserSecretsClient().get_secret("GOOGLE_API_KEY")

Automated retry
		# Define a retry policy. The model might make multiple consecutive calls automatically
		# for a complex query, this ensures the client retries if it hits quota limits.
		from google.api_core import retry

		is_retriable = lambda e: (isinstance(e, genai.errors.APIError) and e.code in {429, 503})

		if not hasattr(genai.models.Models.generate_content, '__wrapped__'):
		  genai.models.Models.generate_content = retry.Retry(
		      predicate=is_retriable)(genai.models.Models.generate_content)
		      
Create a local database
	For this minimal example, you'll create a local SQLite database and add some synthetic data so you have something to query.

	Load the sql IPython extension so you can interact with the database using magic commands (the % instructions) to create a new, empty SQLite database.

		%load_ext sql
		%sql sqlite:///sample.db
	
	The sql extension is already loaded. To reload it, use:
  
  		%reload_ext sql

	Create the tables and insert some synthetic data. Feel free to tweak this structure and data.

		%%sql
		-- Create the 'products' table
		CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS products (
			product_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
			product_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
			price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL
		  );

		-- Create the 'staff' table
		CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS staff (
			staff_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
			first_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
			last_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
		  );

		-- Create the 'orders' table
		CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS orders (
			order_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
			customer_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
			staff_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
			product_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
			FOREIGN KEY (staff_id) REFERENCES staff (staff_id),
			FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products (product_id)
		  );

		-- Insert data into the 'products' table
		INSERT INTO products (product_name, price) VALUES
			('Laptop', 799.99),
			('Keyboard', 129.99),
			('Mouse', 29.99);

		-- Insert data into the 'staff' table
		INSERT INTO staff (first_name, last_name) VALUES
			('Alice', 'Smith'),
			('Bob', 'Johnson'),
			('Charlie', 'Williams');

		-- Insert data into the 'orders' table
		INSERT INTO orders (customer_name, staff_id, product_id) VALUES
			('David Lee', 1, 1),
			('Emily Chen', 2, 2),
			('Frank Brown', 1, 3);
		
			* sqlite:///sample.db
			Done.
			Done.
			Done.

Define database functions
	Function calling with Gemini API's Python SDK can be implemented by defining an OpenAPI schema that is passed to the model. 
	You can also define Python functions and let the SDK inspect them to automatically define the schema. 
	In this latter case, it's important that the functions are type annotated and have accurate docstrings that describe what the functions do - 
	the model has no insight into the function body, so the docs function as the interface.

	By providing three key pieces of functionality - listing tables, describing a table, and executing a query - the LLM (much like a human user) 
	will have the basic tools needed to understand and interrogate the database.

	Start with a database connection that will be used across all of the functions.

		import sqlite3

		db_file = "sample.db"
		db_conn = sqlite3.connect(db_file)
		
	The first function will list all tables available in the database. Define it, and test it out to ensure it works.

		def list_tables() -> list[str]:
		    """Retrieve the names of all tables in the database."""
		    # Include print logging statements so you can see when functions are being called.
		    print(' - DB CALL: list_tables()')

		    cursor = db_conn.cursor()

		    # Fetch the table names.
		    cursor.execute("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';")

		    tables = cursor.fetchall()
		    return [t[0] for t in tables]


		list_tables()
			
			 - DB CALL: list_tables()
			['products', 'sqlite_sequence', 'staff', 'orders']
			
	Once the available tables is known, the next step a database user will need is to understand what columns are available in a given table. 
	Define that too, and test that it works as expected.

		def describe_table(table_name: str) -> list[tuple[str, str]]:
		    """Look up the table schema.

		    Returns:
		      List of columns, where each entry is a tuple of (column, type).
		    """
		    print(f' - DB CALL: describe_table({table_name})')

		    cursor = db_conn.cursor()

		    cursor.execute(f"PRAGMA table_info({table_name});")

		    schema = cursor.fetchall()
		    # [column index, column name, column type, ...]
		    return [(col[1], col[2]) for col in schema]


		describe_table("products")
		
			 - DB CALL: describe_table(products)
			[('product_id', 'INTEGER'),
			 ('product_name', 'VARCHAR(255)'),
			 ('price', 'DECIMAL(10, 2)')]
			 
		Now that the system knows what tables and columns are present, it has enough information to be able to generate and run a SELECT query. Now provide that functionality, and test that it works.

			def execute_query(sql: str) -> list[list[str]]:
			    """Execute an SQL statement, returning the results."""
			    print(f' - DB CALL: execute_query({sql})')

			    cursor = db_conn.cursor()

			    cursor.execute(sql)
			    return cursor.fetchall()


			execute_query("select * from products")
			
				 - DB CALL: execute_query(select * from products)
				[(1, 'Laptop', 799.99),
				 (2, 'Keyboard', 129.99),
				 (3, 'Mouse', 29.99),
				 (4, 'Laptop', 799.99),
				 (5, 'Keyboard', 129.99),
				 (6, 'Mouse', 29.99)]

Implement function calls
	Now you can put it all together in a call to the Gemini API.

	Function calling works by adding specific messages to a chat session. When function schemas are defined and made available to the model and a conversation is started, 
	instead of returning a text response, the model may return a function_call instead. When this happens, the client must respond with a function_response, 
	indicating the result of the call, and the conversation can continue on as normal.

	This function calling interaction normally happens manually, allowing you, the client, to validate and initiate the call. However the Python SDK also 
	supports automatic function calling, where the supplied functions will be automatically invoked. This is a powerful feature and should be used with care, 
	such as when the functions have no side-effects).

	Here's the state diagram representing the conversation flow with function calling. With automatic function calling, the bottom row is executed automatically by the 
	Python SDK. With manual function calling, you write the code to run each step individually.

		# These are the Python functions defined above.
		db_tools = [list_tables, describe_table, execute_query]

		instruction = """You are a helpful chatbot that can interact with an SQL database
		for a computer store. You will take the users questions and turn them into SQL
		queries using the tools available. Once you have the information you need, you will
		answer the user's question using the data returned.

		Use list_tables to see what tables are present, describe_table to understand the
		schema, and execute_query to issue an SQL SELECT query."""

		client = genai.Client(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)

		# Start a chat with automatic function calling enabled.
		chat = client.chats.create(
		    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
		    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
			system_instruction=instruction,
			tools=db_tools,
		    ),
		)
		
	Now you can engage in a chat conversation where you can ask about the contents of the database.

		resp = chat.send_message("What is the cheapest product?")
		print(f"\n{resp.text}")
		
			 - DB CALL: list_tables()
			 - DB CALL: describe_table(products)
			 - DB CALL: execute_query(SELECT product_name, price FROM products ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1)

			The cheapest product is the Mouse, which costs $29.99.

	Explore the chat session and ask your own questions. The 2.0 models are quite capable and can usually answer questions requiring multiple steps.

		chat = client.chats.create(
		    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
		    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
			system_instruction=instruction,
			tools=db_tools,
		    ),
		)

		response = chat.send_message('What products should salesperson Alice focus on to round out her portfolio? Explain why.')
		print(f"\n{response.text}")
 
			 - DB CALL: list_tables()
			 - DB CALL: describe_table(products)
			 - DB CALL: describe_table(staff)
			 - DB CALL: describe_table(orders)
			 - DB CALL: execute_query(SELECT staff_id FROM staff WHERE first_name = 'Alice')
			 - DB CALL: execute_query(SELECT DISTINCT product_id FROM orders WHERE staff_id = 1)
			 - DB CALL: execute_query(SELECT product_id, product_name FROM products)

			Alice has sold Laptop (product_id 1) and Mouse (product id 3). To round out her portfolio, Alice should focus on selling Keyboards (product_id 2 and 5) and Laptops (product_id 4). She has sold one type of laptop already, but there is another type of laptop that she could try to sell to customers.

Inspecting the conversation

	To see the calls that the model makes, and what the client returns in response, you can inspect the chat history. 
	This helper function will print out each turn along with the relevant fields passed or returned.

		import textwrap

		def print_chat_turns(chat):
		    """Prints out each turn in the chat history, including function calls and responses."""
		    for event in chat.get_history():
			print(f"{event.role.capitalize()}:")

			for part in event.parts:
			    if txt := part.text:
				print(f'  "{txt}"')
			    elif fn := part.function_call:
				args = ", ".join(f"{key}={val}" for key, val in fn.args.items())
				print(f"  Function call: {fn.name}({args})")
			    elif resp := part.function_response:
				print("  Function response:")
				print(textwrap.indent(str(resp.response['result']), "    "))

			print()


		print_chat_turns(chat)

			User:
			  "What products should salesperson Alice focus on to round out her portfolio? Explain why."

			Model:
			  Function call: list_tables()

			User:
			  Function response:
			    ['products', 'sqlite_sequence', 'staff', 'orders']

			Model:
			  "Okay, I will start by looking at the products table.
			"
			  Function call: describe_table(table_name=products)

			User:
			  Function response:
			    [('product_id', 'INTEGER'), ('product_name', 'VARCHAR(255)'), ('price', 'DECIMAL(10, 2)')]

			Model:
			  Function call: describe_table(table_name=staff)

			User:
			  Function response:
			    [('staff_id', 'INTEGER'), ('first_name', 'VARCHAR(255)'), ('last_name', 'VARCHAR(255)')]

			Model:
			  Function call: describe_table(table_name=orders)

			User:
			  Function response:
			    [('order_id', 'INTEGER'), ('customer_name', 'VARCHAR(255)'), ('staff_id', 'INTEGER'), ('product_id', 'INTEGER')]

			Model:
			  "Okay, now I have the table schemas. I need to figure out what Alice has already sold, and then suggest products that are not in that set.

			First, I need to find Alice's staff ID.
			"
			  Function call: execute_query(sql=SELECT staff_id FROM staff WHERE first_name = 'Alice')

			User:
			  Function response:
			    [(1,), (4,)]

			Model:
			  "It looks like there are two people named Alice. I will assume the user means the Alice with staff_id = 1. I will proceed, but I will need to ask the user to clarify if this is not correct.

			Now I need to find the products that Alice has sold.
			"
			  Function call: execute_query(sql=SELECT DISTINCT product_id FROM orders WHERE staff_id = 1)

			User:
			  Function response:
			    [(1,), (3,)]

			Model:
			  "Alice has sold products with product_id 1 and 3. I will now find the names of all the products.

			  Function call: execute_query(sql=SELECT product_id, product_name FROM products)

			"

	In this output you can see each of the conversational turns that were made. Note that the model doesn't remember anything outside of the chat history, so you can make changes to the database structure or data and the model will respond without needing any code changes - try this out!

Compositional function calling

	A powerful new feature in Gemini 2.0 is the model's ability to compose user-provided function calls together while generating code.

	This means that the model is able to take the available tools, generate code that uses it, and execute it all.

	The feature requires the Live API, so this step uses different setup code than most of the examples you have seen so far. 
	As the Multimodal Live API is a bi-directional streaming service, everything is set up in advance and then executed. This is a little more complex but the result is quite powerful.

	First define a function that will handle streaming model output. It will stream text output, handle tool-calling and show the generated code that the model 
	writes and executes to fulfill the task.

		from pprint import pformat
		from IPython.display import display, Image, Markdown

		async def handle_response(stream, tool_impl=None):
		  """Stream output and handle any tool calls during the session."""
		  all_responses = []

		  async for msg in stream.receive():
		    all_responses.append(msg)

		    if text := msg.text:
		      # Output any text chunks that are streamed back.
		      if len(all_responses) < 2 or not all_responses[-2].text:
			# Display a header if this is the first text chunk.
			display(Markdown('### Text'))

		      print(text, end='')

		    elif tool_call := msg.tool_call:
		      # Handle tool-call requests.
		      for fc in tool_call.function_calls:
			display(Markdown('### Tool call'))

			# Execute the tool and collect the result to return to the model.
			if callable(tool_impl):
			  try:
			    result = tool_impl(**fc.args)
			  except Exception as e:
			    result = str(e)
			else:
			  result = 'ok'

			tool_response = types.LiveClientToolResponse(
			    function_responses=[types.FunctionResponse(
				name=fc.name,
				id=fc.id,
				response={'result': result},
			    )]
			)
			await stream.send(input=tool_response)

		    elif msg.server_content and msg.server_content.model_turn:
		      # Print any messages showing code the model generated and ran.

		      for part in msg.server_content.model_turn.parts:
			  if code := part.executable_code:
			    display(Markdown(
				f'### Code\n```\n{code.code}\n```'))

			  elif result := part.code_execution_result:
			    display(Markdown(f'### Result: {result.outcome}\n'
					     f'```\n{pformat(result.output)}\n```'))

			  elif img := part.inline_data:
			    display(Image(img.data))

		  print()
  		return all_responses
  		
Textual live database chat
	Now connect to the model and start a conversation.

	The Live API is a streaming API, so this example is fully pre-scripted and only has a single user input. Despite this, the request still requires the model 
	to perform a bit of back-and-forth to interrogate the database, and you should see the model generate some code that uses the execute_query tool in a loop.

		model = 'gemini-2.0-flash-exp'
		live_client = genai.Client(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY,
					   http_options=types.HttpOptions(api_version='v1alpha'))

		# Wrap the existing execute_query tool you used in the earlier example.
		execute_query_tool_def = types.FunctionDeclaration.from_callable(
		    client=live_client, callable=execute_query)

		# Provide the model with enough information to use the tool, such as describing
		# the database so it understands which SQL syntax to use.
		sys_int = """You are a database interface. Use the `execute_query` function
		to answer the users questions by looking up information in the database,
		running any necessary queries and responding to the user.

		You need to look up table schema using sqlite3 syntax SQL, then once an
		answer is found be sure to tell the user. If the user is requesting an
		action, you must also execute the actions.

	In the output from the previous step, you should see a Code section that shows code that the model generated in order to complete the task. It will look something like this:

		sql_statements = [ ... ]

		for sql in sql_statements:
		  print(default_api.execute_query(sql))

	The model then runs this code (remotely), calling out to the provided tool when it reaches that part of the code. The default_api module contains the tools that you provided.

	This example simply executes in a loop, but the models are capable of more complex interactions with multiple tools, giving you a powerful agent 
	framework that's effectively built in to the Gemini API.

Plotting the database

	Try out the built-in agent capability with the next example. You may notice the model try to guess the database schema or environment. 
	Often the model will make mistakes, but you can look through the Text output and watch as the model inspects the error, tries a new approach and learns from its mistakes.

	If the model doesn't return a plot, try running the cell again.
