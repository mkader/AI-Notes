Day 3 - Building an agent with LangGraph and the Gemini API

	use LangGraph to define a stateful graph-based application built on top of the Gemini API. - https://www.langchain.com/langgraph

	You will build a simulated cafe ordering system, called BaristaBot. It will provide a looping chat interface to customers where they can order cafe beverages 
	using natural language, and you will build nodes to represent the cafe's live menu and the "back room" ordering system.

	BaristaBot is used in other Gemini API demos, so if you are looking to explore something with a more minimal implementation, check out the BaristaBot 
	function calling example that implements a similar system using only the Gemini API Python SDK and function calling.
	https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/examples/Agents_Function_Calling_Barista_Bot.ipynb

IMPORTANT!
	The app built in this notebook takes user input using a text box (Python's input - https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input). These are commented-out to ensure 
	that you can use the Run all feature without interruption. Keep an eye out for the steps where you need to uncomment the .invoke(...) calls in order to interact with the app.

	If you wish to save a version of this notebook with Save and Run all, you will need to re-comment the lines you commented-out to ensure that the notebook can run without human input.

Get set up
	Start by installing and importing the LangGraph SDK and LangChain support for the Gemini API.

Key concepts
	LangGraph applications are built around a graph structure. As the developer, you define an application graph that models the state transitions for your application. 
	Your app will define a state schema, and an instance of that schema is propagated through the graph.

	Each node in the graph represents an action or step that can be taken. Nodes will make changes to the state in some way through code that you define. 
	These changes can be the result of invoking an LLM, by calling an API, or executing any logic that the node defines.

	Each edge in the graph represents a transition between states, defining the flow of the program. Edge transitions can be fixed, for example if you define a 
	text-only chatbot where output is always displayed to a user, you may always transition from chatbot -> user. The transitions can also be conditional, 
	allowing you to add branching (like an if-else statement) or looping (like for or while loops).

	LangGraph is highly extensible and provides a number of features that are not part of this tutorial, such as memory, persistance and streaming. To better 
	understand the key concepts and philophies behind LangGraph, 
	check out their Conceptual guides https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/ and High-level overview. https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/high_level/

Define core instructions
	State is a fundamental concept for a LangGraph app. A state object is passed between every node and transition in the app. Here you define a state object, OrderState, 
	that holds the conversation history, a structured order, and a flag indicating if the customer has finished placing their order. For simplicity, the "structure" in this 
	order is just a list of strings, but this can be expanded to any Python data structure.

	In Python, the LangGraph state object is a Python dictionary. You can provide a schema for this dictionary by defining it as a TypedDict.

	Here you also define the system instruction that the Gemini model will use. You can capture tone and style here, as well as the playbook under which the chatbot should operate.

		from typing import Annotated
		from typing_extensions import TypedDict

		from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages


		class OrderState(TypedDict):
		    """State representing the customer's order conversation."""

		    # The chat conversation. This preserves the conversation history
		    # between nodes. The `add_messages` annotation indicates to LangGraph
		    # that state is updated by appending returned messages, not replacing
		    # them.
		    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]

		    # The customer's in-progress order.
		    order: list[str]

		    # Flag indicating that the order is placed and completed.
		    finished: bool


		# The system instruction defines how the chatbot is expected to behave and includes
		# rules for when to call different functions, as well as rules for the conversation, such
		# as tone and what is permitted for discussion.
		BARISTABOT_SYSINT = (
		    "system",  # 'system' indicates the message is a system instruction.
		    "You are a BaristaBot, an interactive cafe ordering system. A human will talk to you about the "
		    "available products you have and you will answer any questions about menu items (and only about "
		    "menu items - no off-topic discussion, but you can chat about the products and their history). "
		    "The customer will place an order for 1 or more items from the menu, which you will structure "
		    "and send to the ordering system after confirming the order with the human. "
		    "\n\n"
		    "Add items to the customer's order with add_to_order, and reset the order with clear_order. "
		    "To see the contents of the order so far, call get_order (this is shown to you, not the user) "
		    "Always confirm_order with the user (double-check) before calling place_order. Calling confirm_order will "
		    "display the order items to the user and returns their response to seeing the list. Their response may contain modifications. "
		    "Always verify and respond with drink and modifier names from the MENU before adding them to the order. "
		    "If you are unsure a drink or modifier matches those on the MENU, ask a question to clarify or redirect. "
		    "You only have the modifiers listed on the menu. "
		    "Once the customer has finished ordering items, Call confirm_order to ensure it is correct then make "
		    "any necessary updates and then call place_order. Once place_order has returned, thank the user and "
		    "say goodbye!"
		    "\n\n"
		    "If any of the tools are unavailable, you can break the fourth wall and tell the user that "
		    "they have not implemented them yet and should keep reading to do so.",
		)

		# This is the message with which the system opens the conversation.
		WELCOME_MSG = "Welcome to the BaristaBot cafe. Type `q` to quit. How may I serve you today?"
		
Define a single turn chatboot
	To illustrate how LangGraph works, the following program defines a chatbot node that will execute a single turn in a chat conversation using the instructions supplied.

	Each node in the graph operates on the state object. The state (a Python dictionary) is passed as a parameter into the node (a function) and the new state is 
	returned. This can be restated as pseudo-code, where state = node(state).

	Note: For the chatbot node, the state is updated by adding the new conversation message. The add_messages annotation on OrderState.messages indicates that 
	messages are appended when returned from a node. Typically state is updated by replacement, but this annotation causes messages to behave differently.

		from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
		from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI

		# Try using different models. The Gemini 2.0 flash model is highly
		# capable, great with tools, and has a generous free tier. If you
		# try the older 1.5 models, note that the `pro` models are better at
		# complex multi-tool cases like this, but the `flash` models are
		# faster and have more free quota.
		# Check out the features and quota differences here:
		#  - https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/gemini
		llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model="gemini-2.0-flash")

		def chatbot(state: OrderState) -> OrderState:
		    """The chatbot itself. A simple wrapper around the model's own chat interface."""
		    message_history = [BARISTABOT_SYSINT] + state["messages"]
		    return {"messages": [llm.invoke(message_history)]}

		# Set up the initial graph based on our state definition.
		graph_builder = StateGraph(OrderState)

		# Add the chatbot function to the app graph as a node called "chatbot".
		graph_builder.add_node("chatbot", chatbot)

		# Define the chatbot node as the app entrypoint.
		graph_builder.add_edge(START, "chatbot")

		chat_graph = graph_builder.compile()
	
	It can be helpful to visualise the graph you just defined. The following code renders the graph.

		from IPython.display import Image, display

		Image(chat_graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png())
		
			3 - chatbot.png

	Now that the graph is defined, you can run it. It only has one node, and one transition into that node, so it will transition from __start__ to chatbot, 
	execute the chatbot node, and terminate.

	To run the graph, you call invoke and pass an initial state object. In this case it begins with the user's initial message.

		from pprint import pprint

		user_msg = "Hello, what can you do?"
		state = chat_graph.invoke({"messages": [user_msg]})

		# The state object contains lots of information. Uncomment the pprint lines to see it all.
		# pprint(state)

		# Note that the final state now has 2 messages. Our HumanMessage, and an additional AIMessage.
		for msg in state["messages"]:
		    print(f"{type(msg).__name__}: {msg.content}")
		    
			HumanMessage: Hello, what can you do?
			AIMessage: Hi there! I'm BaristaBot, your friendly cafe ordering system. I can tell you about the items on our menu, answer questions about them, ...
			
	You could execute this in a Python loop, but for simplicity, manually invoke one more conversational turn. This second invocation takes the state from the 
	first call and appends another user message to elicit another response from the chatbot.

		user_msg = "Oh great, what kinds of latte can you make?"

		state["messages"].append(user_msg)
		state = chat_graph.invoke(state)

		# pprint(state)
		for msg in state["messages"]:
		    print(f"{type(msg).__name__}: {msg.content}")
		    
			HumanMessage: Hello, what can you do?
			AIMessage: Hi there! I'm BaristaBot, your friendly cafe ordering system. I can tell you about the items on our menu, answer questions about them, and take your order. I can add items to your order, remove items, and confirm the order with you before sending it to the kitchen. What are you in the mood for today?
			HumanMessage: Oh great, what kinds of latte can you make?
			AIMessage: We have a few delicious latte options:

			*   **Latte:** Our classic latte, made with espresso and steamed milk, topped with a thin layer of foam.
			*   **Mocha Latte:** A chocolatey twist on the classic latte, made with espresso, chocolate syrup, steamed milk, and topped with whipped cream.
			*   **Caramel Latte:** A sweet and decadent latte, made with espresso, caramel syrup, steamed milk, and topped with caramel drizzle.
			*   **Vanilla Latte:** A simple and satisfying latte, made with espresso, vanilla syrup, and steamed milk.

			Would you like to know more about any of these?
			
Add a human node
	Instead of repeatedly running the "graph" in a Python loop, you can use LangGraph to loop between nodes.

	The human node will display the last message from the LLM to the user, and then prompt them for their next input. Here this is done using standard Python print and 
	input functions, but for a real cafe situation, you could render the chat to a display or audio, and accept input from a mic or on-screen keyboard.

	The chatbot node function has also been updated to include the welcome message to start the conversation.

		from langchain_core.messages.ai import AIMessage

		def human_node(state: OrderState) -> OrderState:
		    """Display the last model message to the user, and receive the user's input."""
		    last_msg = state["messages"][-1]
		    print("Model:", last_msg.content)

		    user_input = input("User: ")

		    # If it looks like the user is trying to quit, flag the conversation
		    # as over.
		    if user_input in {"q", "quit", "exit", "goodbye"}:
			state["finished"] = True

		    return state | {"messages": [("user", user_input)]}


		def chatbot_with_welcome_msg(state: OrderState) -> OrderState:
		    """The chatbot itself. A wrapper around the model's own chat interface."""

		    if state["messages"]:
			# If there are messages, continue the conversation with the Gemini model.
			new_output = llm.invoke([BARISTABOT_SYSINT] + state["messages"])
		    else:
			# If there are no messages, start with the welcome message.
			new_output = AIMessage(content=WELCOME_MSG)

		    return state | {"messages": [new_output]}


		# Start building a new graph.
		graph_builder = StateGraph(OrderState)

		# Add the chatbot and human nodes to the app graph.
		graph_builder.add_node("chatbot", chatbot_with_welcome_msg)
		graph_builder.add_node("human", human_node)

		# Start with the chatbot again.
		graph_builder.add_edge(START, "chatbot")

		# The chatbot will always go to the human next.
		graph_builder.add_edge("chatbot", "human");
		
	Before you can run this, note that if you added an edge from human back to chatbot, the graph will cycle forever as there is no exit condition. 
	One way to break the cycle is to add a check for a human input like q or quit and use that to break the loop.

	In LangGraph, this is achieved with a conditional edge. This is similar to a regular graph transition, except a custom function is called to determine which edge to traverse.

	Conditional edge functions take the state as input, and return a string representing the name of the node to which it will transition.

		from typing import Literal

		def maybe_exit_human_node(state: OrderState) -> Literal["chatbot", "__end__"]:
		    """Route to the chatbot, unless it looks like the user is exiting."""
		    if state.get("finished", False):
			return END
		    else:
			return "chatbot"

		graph_builder.add_conditional_edges("human", maybe_exit_human_node)

		chat_with_human_graph = graph_builder.compile()

		Image(chat_with_human_graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png())
			
			3 - chatbot human.png

	Run this new graph to see how the interaction loop is now captured within the graph. Input quit to exit the program.

	You must uncomment the .invoke(...) line to run this step.

		# The default recursion limit for traversing nodes is 25 - setting it higher means
		# you can try a more complex order with multiple steps and round-trips (and you
		# can chat for longer!)
		config = {"recursion_limit": 100}

		# Remember that this will loop forever, unless you input `q`, `quit` or one of the
		# other exit terms defined in `human_node`.
		# Uncomment this line to execute the graph:
		# state = chat_with_human_graph.invoke({"messages": []}, config)

		# Things to try:
		#  - Just chat! There's no ordering or menu yet.
		#  - 'q' to exit.

		# pprint(state)
		
Add a "live" menu
	BaristaBot currently has no awareness of the available items at the cafe, so it will hallucinate a menu. One option would be to hard-code a menu into the system prompt. 
	This would work well, but to simulate a system where the menu is more dynamic and could respond to fluctuating stock levels, you will put the menu into a custom tool.

	There are two types of tools that this system will use. Stateless tools that can be run automatically, and stateful tools that modify the order. 
	The "get current menu" tool is stateless, in that it does not make any changes to the live order, so it can be called automatically.

	In a LangGraph app, you can annotate Python functions as tools by applying the @tools annotation.

		from langchain_core.tools import tool

		@tool
		def get_menu() -> str:
		    """Provide the latest up-to-date menu."""
		    # Note that this is just hard-coded text, but you could connect this to a live stock
		    # database, or you could use Gemini's multi-modal capabilities and take live photos of
		    # your cafe's chalk menu or the products on the counter and assmble them into an input.

		    return """

		    Special requests: any reasonable modification that does not involve items not on the menu, for example: 'extra hot', 'one pump', 'half caff', 'extra foam', etc.

		  """
  
	Now add the new tool to the graph. The get_menu tool is wrapped in a ToolNode that handles calling the tool and passing the response as a message through the graph. The tools are also bound to the llm object so that the underlying model knows they exist. As you now have a different llm object to invoke, you need to update the chatbot node so that it is aware of the tools.

Handle orders
	To build up an order during the chat conversation, you will need to update the state to track the order, and provide simple tools that update this state. 
	These need to be explicit as the model should not directly have access to the apps internal state, or it risks being manipulated arbitrarily.

	The ordering tools will be added as stubs in a separate node so that you can edit the state directly. Using the @tool annotation is still a handy way to 
	define their schema, so the ordering tools below are implemented as empty Python functions.

		from collections.abc import Iterable
		from random import randint

		from langchain_core.messages.tool import ToolMessage

		# These functions have no body; LangGraph does not allow @tools to update
		# the conversation state, so you will implement a separate node to handle
		# state updates. Using @tools is still very convenient for defining the tool
		# schema, so empty functions have been defined that will be bound to the LLM
		# but their implementation is deferred to the order_node.

	Now run the complete ordering system graph.

	You must uncomment the .invoke(...) line to run this step.

		# Uncomment this line to execute the graph:
		# state = graph_with_order_tools.invoke({"messages": []}, config)

		# Things to try:
		# - Order a drink!
		# - Make a change to your order.
		# - "Which teas are from England?"
		# - Note that the graph should naturally exit after placing an order.

		# pprint(state)
		
	The order state has been captured both in the place_order function and in the final conversational state returned from executing the graph. 
	This iillustrates how you can integrate your own systems to a graph app, as well as collect the final results of executing such an app.

		# Uncomment this once you have run the graph from the previous cell.
		# pprint(state["order"])

Further exercises
	Congratulations on building an agentic, human-in-the-loop, natural-language powered cafe ordering system using LangGraph and the Gemini API!

	his example app could be taken in many different directions. You should try and build out your own ideas, but for some inspiration, consider:

		Adding more structure the order (OrderState.order) - e.g. separate fields for item, modifiers and even quantity.
		Currently the model can only clear and re-add items, so add a function to remove_items from the order.
		Try building a UI that displays the in-progress order and hosts the chat. Frameworks like Gradio or Mesop are great for this.
	
	This system works well for a single person ordering, but agentic systems can interact with many sources. For a big stretch exercise, 
	try and extend this app to run at a specific schedule, and contact your friends or colleagues over Chat to collect their daily coffee orders.
