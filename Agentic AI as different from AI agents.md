* Should we think of Agentic AI as different from AI agents?

* AI agents are great at doing. But agentic AI? That’s when you let a network of agents collaborate, plan, and adapt 

* We’re talking AI systems that:
  1️. Set their own sub-goals
  2️. Use APIs, tools, and browsers on the fly
  3️. Work in role-based teams (planners, critics, doers)

* Real-world examples:
  1. GitHub Copilot Workspace: end-to-end dev cycles, no hand-holding
  1. AutoGPT & AutoGen: self-driven agents that reason, iterate, and act
  1. CrewAI / LangGraph: orchestrated teamwork across autonomous agents

* What does this unlock for enterprise?
  1. 20%+ cost reduction
  1. 30%+ productivity boost
  1. SaaS → Service-as-a-Software (pay per outcome, not per seat)
  1. Multimodal insights (text, image, audio)—no silos 

* To summarize :
  1. AI agents = tools.
  1. Agentic AI = an intelligent system that works like a team.
