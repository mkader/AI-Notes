* 5 Agentic LLM Patterns You Should Be Using (But Might Not Be) 

* Here's a quick breakdoww
 
1️. Prompt chaining
  * Chain multiple LLMs together. Each step validates or filters before moving forward.
  * Use it for: complex reasoning, layered tasks, or multi-step validation.

2️. Routing
  * Send inputs to the right agent based on context. Think of it like a smart traffic cop.
  * Use it for: task classification, customer support, or auto-escalation systems.

3️. Orchestrator
  * One LLM acts as the boss, delegating tasks to others and merging results.
  * Use it for: planning, synthesis, or multi-agent decision making.

4️. Parallelization
  * Run several LLM calls at once, then blend outputs using app logic.
  * Use it for: batch summarization, content generation, or comparison.

5️. Evaluator-Optimizer
  * The LLM critiques itself (or another). If the output’s not good enough, it loops back for improvement.
  * Use it for: code generation, reinforcement loops, or quality control.

* Whether you’re building in LangChain, CrewAI, or OpenAI Functions, these blueprints work across the stack.
