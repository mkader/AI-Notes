10 High-Leverage Takeaways From Anthropic's Latest Document On Agentic Coding

If you‚Äôre serious about AI-native development, this doc is a goldmine. üëá 

1Ô∏è‚É£Set Claude up for success with CLAUDE.md
Use this file to preload context Claude should always reference: bash commands, repo quirks, branch rules, testing instructions. Keep it short, human-readable, and tailored.

2Ô∏è‚É£Stack your tools
Claude can tap into Bash, GitHub CLI (gh), Puppeteer, APIs, or your own scripts. Configure them upfront or teach Claude through usage + examples.

3Ô∏è‚É£Use structured workflows
Trigger "think", "think hard", or "ultrathink" modes to get deeper reasoning. Then ask Claude to plan, code, test, and commit. Sequential thinking > spaghetti prompts.

4Ô∏è‚É£Run multi-Claude sessions
Use one Claude to write, another to review, and a third to iterate. Anthropic teams do this to avoid context collisions and boost code quality.

5Ô∏è‚É£Go headless for CI/CD
Use claude -p to trigger Claude from scripts or GitHub Actions for auto-triage, code cleanup, or subjective linting. Add --output-format stream-json for structured logs.

6Ô∏è‚É£Work smarter with checklists
For linting or migrations, have Claude generate a Markdown checklist, then work through it step-by-step. Helps avoid scattered context and unfinished fixes.

7Ô∏è‚É£Skip supervision when safe
--dangerously-skip-permissions lets Claude run freely. Only use in sandboxed or containerized environments, ideally without internet access. Great for boilerplate or cleanup jobs.

8Ô∏è‚É£Ask like an engineer, not a magician
Claude performs best with clear, specific instructions. Tell it what to do, what not to do, and where to look. Mention file names, URLs, or even drag-drop screenshots.

9Ô∏è‚É£Auto-generate slash commands
Save repeated workflows as .claude/commands/*.md files. Claude will recognize them as slash commands like /project:fix-github-issue.

üîüUse Claude like a team member
Treat Claude as a junior dev: pair program with it, ask it to reflect, undo, or course-correct mid-task. And use /clear often to reset its mental whiteboard.
