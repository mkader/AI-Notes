* If you’re building or deploying agents, this is your cheat code to stay ahead of exploits⤵️ 

* Autonomous AI agents can now handle tasks, use external tools, and make decisions on their own. Cool, right? 

* But here’s the problem: they also open up dangerous attack paths that traditional app security doesn’t cover.

* Palo Alto Networks just dropped one of the most practical deep dives we’ve seen:

* Highlights:
  1. Prompt injection attacks that hijack agent behavior
  1. Malicious use of external tools
  1. Code execution via insecure interpreters
  1. Credential leaks from exposed metadata
  1. And nine (!) real-world scenarios where things went sideways

* The report lays out exactly how to secure these systems: sandboxing, input hardening, tool validation, and layered defenses that go way beyond “just use HTTPS.”
