* The protocol comparison that I wish I knew earlier for AI Agents

* Let us understand which protocols are best suited for you....

* Model Context Protocol (MCP)
  1. Operates on a client-server model with JSON-RPC for structured communication between LLMs and external tools.
  1. Allows LLMs to interact with external tools, datasets, and APIs.
  1. Supports predefined prompts and tools.
  1. While primarily token-based, it optionally supports Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) for secure authentication.
  1. Primarily stateless, but allows for an optional persistent tool context.
  1. Use-case: Integrate AI Agents with multiple tools using servers with less code integration.

* Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A)
  1. Facilitates direct communication between the client and remote agents.
  1. Uses Agent Cards (JSON metadata) for capability discovery.
  1. Supports DIDs for secure, trustful authentication between agents.
  1. Supports SSE and push notifications for real-time updates and asynchronous communication.
  1. Use-case: Delegate project tasks dynamically among specialised agents for efficient and expert-driven workflows.

* Agent Network Protocol (ANP)
  1. Operates on a fully decentralised model, using DIDs and JSON-LD for trustless, peer-to-peer communication.
  1. Agents are discovered through search engines, enabling scalable and open internet-based agent networks.
  1. Supports dynamic protocol negotiation, allowing agents to adapt communication methods at runtime.
  1. Use-case: Create a decentralised marketplace to discover and interact with third-party agent services securely and efficiently.

* Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)
  1. Uses a centralised registry for agent discovery and task routing.
  1. Supports structured multipart messages with MIME-typed parts, enabling rich and flexible data exchange.
  1. Runs on states and supports session-aware interactions, ideal for multi-turn workflows.
  1. Agents are discovered through a centralised registry.
  1. Use-case: Automate workflows across departments with MCP Style communication with structured and multi-model messages.
